Designer of a complex dinner.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specification:

Develop the application, which allows to make a lunch of multiple dishes, thus there has to be a possibility to choose several portions of one dish. Each dish has a price, a photo, a name, and some additional fields which are necessary in your opinion. The list of dishes is presented in the table form. The chosen dishes have to be highlighted. In a process of a drawing up a lunch, there has to be a calculation of a total cost. After drawing up a lunch the user has to have an opportunity to confirm his choice and as a result of this action there should be a popup window with the confirming message. It is impossible to use window.alert for display of popup windows, instead it is possible to use any third-party component for development time reduction.

That is estimated: the understanding of the principle of a template of development of MVVM, the ability to correct structure a code in the terms of MVVM, the optimum use of opportunities of Knockout, the design of UI shouldn't cause rejection, but at the same time you shouldn't concentrate on it too much.

Obligatory elements of realization:

Applying at least once the calculated properties (computed properties).

Applying the user type binding (custom bindings).
